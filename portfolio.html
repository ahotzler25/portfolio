                <p>Tested and helped launch <i>Halo: Infinite</i>'s seasons 6 and 7. Met daily with clients and stakeholders to provide reports on health of my areas, build
                  status, and ensuring there were no high-severity/high-priority issues blocking QA.
                  <br><br>
                  Mentored new testers (either to the project or to QA generally) by guiding them through team processes,
                  QA best practices, and bug reporting. Created and updated internal documentation regarding nascent 
                  QA processes and tools.

                  test cases to ensure all features and mechanics were properly tested and functional. Met daily with publishing and reported on build health, BVT status,

              <p>Master of Arts, Creative Thesis: Bemidji State University</p>
              <p>Written in Twine: SugarCube 2.x</p>
              <p><i>Lost in the Shadows Between Worlds</i> is an interactive narrative that follows a 
                young father struggling to maintain composure and himself beside his teenage daughter's 
                hospital bed as he fights through his grief, confusion, and anger. Modeled after Ernest 
                Hemingway's 1927 short story "Hills Like White Elephants" and stylistically inspired by 
                Cormac McCarthy, Toni Morrison, and <i>Mass Effect</i>, there's an elephant in a room that no one can say; even 
                the hospital staff dance around the word. Each choice causes subtle changes in characterization 
                and reader interpretation, leaving each reading a slightly different experience.</p>

                <p>This project successfully (and to great praise) met the Master of Arts, English 
                  thesis requirements with "Full Honors". Degree awarded May 2023.</p>

              <p>Unreal Engine 5 and C++/Blueprints</p>
              <p>Primary responsibilities:</p>

              <ul><li>Puzzle design</li></ul>
              <ul><li>Audio and SFX</li></ul>
              <p>Play as two characters: one a knight in shining armor, the other a clumsy, 
                awkward Bloo, both trying to make it through trans-dimensional dungeons to 
                escape. Each dungeon is mirrored, a replica of the other in their respective 
                world. Each character quickly learns they're not in this alone. They must work 
                together in order to escape before whatever put them in their dungeons returns.
                
                The game was created in seven days for the GameDevTV Game Jam 2023.</p>

            <p>Below is a barksheet written for God of War (2018) and God of War: Ragnarok. Most of them are context-specific, but are still
              general enough that they can be modular (i.e. using variable strings when moving away from an objective allows the barks to be repurposed and reused
              in different parts of the game. See the additional notes section in the barksheet for more information.) Similarly, outside of additional VO and (perhaps) some additional animations, there are no additional assets or requirements
              that would be needed.</p>

            <h3><i>Hunt: Showdown</i> - Found Lore</h3>
            <p>Below is a sample of found lore in the form of a diary entry, written by an unknown monster hunter 
              at an unknown time. It chronicles the few details the hunter learned of a monster that haunted the Bayou 
              simply known as "the Priestess." Many hunter diaries exist with efforts made to collate them into a 
              single tome called <i>The Bayou Bestiary</i>.

                <br><br>
                  It’s difficult to sift through all the accounts of encounters with the monster just called the Priestess. These documents somehow 
                  span nigh a century. Most do have one common thread: a beautiful belle walking alone at night, seemingly unaware of her 
                  surroundings, but once she is approached, a wholly separate entity replaces the once-benign woman; tattoos covering her arms, legs, and face, 
                  with deep scars across her forearms and open midriff—a stark white of scar tissue against a caramel-brown skin—but most terrifying is her hair, 
                  which at first appear as dreads, but upon closer inspection, they sway and hiss not unlike water moccasins, perhaps as many as thirty that rise 
                  up beside that haunting visage. Perhaps her eyes do suck the souls of her victims, but at this time I cannot confirm this.
                  <br><br>
                  The hunters who’ve survived the encounter chronicle the Priestess preferring distance to grant her time to perform her blasphemous ritual, 
                  summoning voodoo dolls to life to explode, shooting shrapnel in all directions. No armor has yet been discovered to stop these from piercing 
                  one’s body, almost guided by something supernatural one can never accurately articulate.</p>
