              <p>Master of Arts, Creative Thesis: Bemidji State University (Written in Twine - SugarCube 2)</p>
              <p>"Lost in the Shadows Between Worlds" is a choice-based branching narrative that follows a 
                young father struggling to maintain composure and himself beside his teenage daughter's 
                hospital bed as he fights through his grief, confusion, and anger. Modeled after Ernest 
                Hemingway's 1927 short story "Hills Like White Elephants" and stylistically inspired by 
                Cormac McCarthy, Toni Morrison, and <i>Mass Effect</i>, there's an elephant in a room that no one can say; even 
                the hospital staff dance around the word. Each choice causes subtle changes in characterization 
                and reader interpretation, leaving each reading a slightly different experience.</p>

                <p>This project successfully (and to great praise) met the Master of Arts, English 
                  thesis requirements. Degree awarded May 2023.</p>

              <p>GameDev.TV GameJam 2023 Entry (Ten days)</p>
              <p>Theme: Life in two dimensions</p>
              <p>Play as two characters, one a knight in shining armor, the other a clumsy, 
                awkward Bloo, both trying to make it through trans-dimensional dungeons to 
                escape. Each dungeon is mirrored, a replica of the other in their respective 
                world. Each character quickly learns they're not in this alone. They must work 
                together in order to escape before whatever put them in their dungeons returns.

                The game was created in 10 days, for the GameDevTV Game Jam 2023.</p>

        <!-- SAMPLES -->
        <div class="project">
          <h2>Writing Samples</h2>
          Here is a smattering of writing samples.
        </div>
        <p>I studied English language and literature for ten years, earning my Master of Arts degree in English in May 2023. 
          I've expertise in a wide range of areas including: narrative, traditional and digital literature, rhetoric, narrative 
          structures, creative writing, characterization, dialogue, narrative design, non-linear/branching narratives, et cetera. 
          I taught College Writing I and II for four and a half years, which helped me hone my problem-solving skills, interpersonal 
          communication, and my ability to think critically and creatively.</p>

          <p>I also have scripting and programming experience, as I'm proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, SQL, 
            and React. I hold a certificate in C++/Blueprints/UE5 working through GameDev.TV's "Unreal Engine C++ Developer" course.</p>
          
          <p>Music and literature are my two main passions, and for months I've gone down the rabbit hole of video game SFX, foley 
            sounds, sound design, composition, anything related to what makes audio in video games incredible. I'm currently working 
            through receiving a sound design certification, working in REAPER and FL Studio 21, and will continue plumbing the depths 
            to uncover anything I may be missing.</p>
          
          <p>Research interests: game design and development, foley sounds, media composition, video game SFX/foley sounds, game theory, 
            Unreal/C++, Unity/C#, machine learning, semiotics, 19th- and 20th-century literature, German history and literature, 
            (digital) rhetoric, cultural studies, censorship.</p>
