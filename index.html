        <h2>Greetings, Traveller!</h2>
        <p>I'm a game writer and narrative designer that loves to craft immersive stories to support
          fun and rivetting gameplay. 
          
        <p>I've studied English language and literature for just over a decade, earning my Master of Arts, English degree in May 2023. 
          I wrote a creative thesis, titled "Lost in the Shadows Between Worlds", which is a branching narrative in Twine's SugarCube 2.
          I specialize in narrative, storytelling, dialogue, style, characterization, and rhetoric, but am also knowledgeable in 
          narrative structures, narrative design, and linear and branching narratives.</p>

          <p>I also have scripting and programming experience, be it Twine (primarily SugarCube 2), web development
          and tools (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, et cetera), or C++ (certificate from GameDev.TV: "C++ Fundamentals: Game Programming for Beginners").</p>
          
          <p>Music and literature are my two main passions, and I continued to dive down rabbit holes regarding video game writing, 
            narrative structures, narrative and quest design, video game SFX, and sound design. I'm finishing
            an online certificate titled "Video Game Writing Essentials" offered by University of British Columbia
            to refamiliarize myself with the basics and strengthen the fundamentals.</p>
            
          <p>I have QA experience, currently working on an unreleased AAA game. I'm familiar with the software development lifecyle,
            and thanks to my background in both QA and programming, I'm comfortable collaborating and brainstorming with all game dev teams.</p>  

          <p>Research interests: game design and development, player autonomy, player immersion, UX, foley sounds, video game SFX/foley sounds, game theory, 
            Unreal/C++, Unity/C#, semiotics, 19th- and 20th-century literature, German history and literature, (digital) rhetoric, cultural studies, censorship.</p>
