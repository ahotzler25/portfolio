        <h2>Greetings, Traveller!</h2>
        <p>I studied English language and literature for ten years, earning my Master of Arts degree in English in May 2023. 
          I've expertise in a wide range of areas including: narrative, traditional and digital literature, rhetoric, narrative 
          structures, creative writing, characterization, dialogue, narrative design, non-linear/branching narratives, et cetera. 
          I taught College Writing I and II for four and a half years, which helped me hone my problem-solving skills, interpersonal 
          communication, and my ability to think critically and creatively.</p>

          <p>I also have scripting and programming experience, as I'm proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, SQL, 
            and React. I hold a certificate in C++/Blueprints/UE5 working through GameDev.TV's "Unreal Engine C++ Developer" course.</p>
          
          <p>Music and literature are my two main passions, and for months I've gone down the rabbit hole of video game SFX, foley 
            sounds, sound design, composition, anything related to what makes audio in video games incredible. I'm currently working 
            through receiving a sound design certification, working in REAPER and FL Studio 21, and will continue plumbing the depths 
            to uncover anything I may be missing.</p>
          
          <p>Research interests: game design and development, foley sounds, media composition, video game SFX/foley sounds, game theory, 
            Unreal/C++, Unity/C#, machine learning, semiotics, 19th- and 20th-century literature, German history and literature, 
            (digital) rhetoric, cultural studies, censorship.</p>
