        <h2>Greetings, Traveller!</h2>
        <p>I studied English language and literature for ten years, earning my Master of Arts degree in English in May 2023. 
          I specialize in narrative, storytelling, dialogue, style, characterization, and rhetoric, but am also knowledgeable in 
          narrative structures, creative writing, narrative design, and on-linear/branching narratives.</p>

          <p>I also have scripting and programming experience, having written my Master's thesis in Twine's SugarCube 2. I have experience
            in the web dev suite of languages and tools (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, et cetera). I also hold a certificate in 
            C++/Blueprints/UE5 working through GameDev.TV's "Unreal Engine C++ Developer" course.</p>
          
          <p>Music and literature are my two main passions, and for months I've gone down the rabbit hole of video game writing, 
            narrative structures, narrative and quest design, video game SFX, and sound design. I'm finishing
            an online certification course titled "Video Game Writing Essentials" offered by University of British Columbia
            to refamiliarize myself with the basics and strengthen the foundation all other writing is built on.</p>
            
          <p>Research interests: game design and development, foley sounds, media composition, video game SFX/foley sounds, game theory, 
            Unreal/C++, Unity/C#, semiotics, 19th- and 20th-century literature, German history and literature, 
            (digital) rhetoric, cultural studies, censorship.</p>
